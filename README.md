# Word-Guess-Game

This is an Ocean-Themed Hangman Game
https://adrianb13.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

Once you click Start, it will automatically pick a word for you to guess.  Your only hint is that it's ocean-related.  Could be an creature or a feature of the ocean.  You only have a certain amount of wrong guesses allowed before you win or lose. You can keep playing once you have completed/missed a word.

The game was created using JavaScript (no jQuery).
